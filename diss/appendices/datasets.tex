\section{Transductive datasets}
These datasets are such that during training the node representations of nodes outside of the training set are ``seen'' by the model but importantly the model does not ``see'' the labels for these nodes.
The model will later be tested on the labels of these additional nodes without access to the training sets labels.
This is because the training, validation and test sets are sampled from the nodes, but if only these nodes where given to the model the structure of the graph is lost and a large proportion of the nodes will no longer be connected.
\note{Include a diagram!}.
This dataset forces the model to transfer knowledge about existing representation, label pairs to unlabelled nodes.

\section{Inductive datasets}
These datasets are such that the nodes ``seen'' during training, validation and testing are completely disjoint.
This is generally the case in graph classification tasks where each data point is a unique graph with a classification thus the test set is a new set of graphs with completely unseen nodes.
This dataset forces the model to induce information of relationships between nodes and optimal representations.
