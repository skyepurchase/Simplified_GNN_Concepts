\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

\note{This is a first draft I am not sure what specifically should go here}

This project analyses the effect that simplifying graph neural networks has on the graph concepts that are extracted from a trained model.
It focuses specifically on the widely aclaimed Simplified Graph Convolution \cite{wu2019simplifying}[SGC] which removes the non-linearity between layers from previous graph neural network approaches reducing the problem of graph representational learning to a precomputation on the graph structure and a single linear regressor.
Using the graph concept extraction method and metrics proposed in \textit{Magister et. al} \cite{magister2021gcexplainer} the project aims to compare the concepts from trained SGC models to a baseline of Graph Convolution Network models.
Further extensions then build on SGC to see which techniques can improve accuracy and concept metrics.

\section*{Work Completed}

The project was a success. 
It fulfilled all the success criteria and further demonstrated that the Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) does not produce as rich concepts as the Graph Convolution Network under the metrics of concept purity and completeness. 
Furthermore, it demonstrated that in the case of highly synthetic data SGC is unable to match the performance of GCN by a significant margin. 
My extensions demonstrate that in the case of real-world graph datasets, where graph structure is important, SGC continues to underperform compared to GCN and does not produce comparable concepts.
Furthermore, when extending the architecture of SGC there is significant improvement when using them within jumping knowledge networks\cite{xu2018representation}.
Additional work on combing SGC and GCN to gain the benefits of both systems has also proven to be successful.
However, overall SGC does not appear to be a suitable candidate for graph representational learning.
%I additionally set out to create a new parameterised dataset to further analyse the shortcomings of SGC when dealing with graph structure.
